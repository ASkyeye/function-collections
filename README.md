A bunch of interesting functions I have found while digging through windows. 

Most of these funtions have been found using [Hoontr](https://github.com/whokilleddb/hoontr) - another tool I wrote a while back, so if like the tricks contained in this repo, or the tool itself - consider [Buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/whokilleddb) to help me stay awake through more night.
